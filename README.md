# ScaffoldDemo

Boilerplate scafford work for Android apps

# Features
- a top bar
  - updates the screen title dynamically
  - icons for each screen
- nav bar with 4 items
  - each will navigate to it's respective screen
  - no back arrow for these is intended to focus on pure bottom navigation
- FAB
  - opens to a dedicated screen/view/actvity
  - back arrow here as this view is full screen
  - button shrinks out of view
  - nav bar slides off screen
  - both return on back arrow interaction

 - Known Bugs
   - using side navigation goes back to Home but nav bar does not return
     - pressing fab does return nav bar though

 # TODO
 - fix nav bug above
 - play around with fab screen color change when entering screen(fade to fab button color)
